                    As I've been involved in coding for a while, I'd like to
                    provide an introduction to this subject for newcomers. And
                    I'm also going to give some pieces of advice for you. Most
                    of the newcomers are tend to do Frontend Development by
                    using languages like HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I'm also one of
                    them. üòÄ

                <p>
                    In the beginning it can be very easy for you as you can see
                    an output of your code immediately. However, after starting
                    to dive deeper into JavaScript frameworks & libraries like
                    Angular, Vue, React & NextJs, frontend development can make
                    your life like hell almost (just kidding üòÖ), if you didn't
                    practice those very well.

                            Plenty of people think that frontend development is
                            easier than backend development. But I have to
                            respectfully disagree to that because both of them
                            have their own complexities.

                            programming language, there are hundreds of concepts
                            and theories to learn. To be honest, I guess the
                            backend has more theories based on my experience.
