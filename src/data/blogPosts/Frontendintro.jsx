                    As I've been involved in coding for a while, I'd like to
                    provide an introduction to this subject for newcomers. And
                    I'm also going to give some pieces of advice for you. Most
                    of the newcomers are tend to do Frontend Development by
                    using languages like HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I'm also one of
                    them. üòÄ

                <p>
                    In the beginning it can be very easy for you as you can see
                    an output of your code immediately. However, after starting
                    to dive deeper into JavaScript frameworks & libraries like
                    Angular, Vue, React & NextJs, frontend development can make
                    your life like hell almost (just kidding üòÖ), if you didn't
                    practice those very well.

                            easier than backend development. But I have to
                            respectfully disagree to that because both of them
                            have their own complexities.

                            and theories to learn. To be honest, I guess the
                            backend has more theories based on my experience.

                                As an example think, you have learned how to do
                                mathematical operations, logging a message to
                                the browser console and utilizing control
                                structures such as if statements and for loops
                                with JavaScript. By using those you can actually
                                create a simple calculator right? So, think for
                                sometime how to do it and try it on your own.
                                Don't google those things as a beginner.

                                3. Learn how to use Frontend Frameworks.
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                When talking about frameworks, they are just
                                reusable code written by some other developers.
                                There are CSS frameworks that you will learn
                                along your journey, such as Bootstrap and
                                Tailwind, which are very easy to understand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, when it comes to JavaScript libraries
                                like React, Angular, Vue, NextJs & etc, it can
                                be very confusing as a beginner. Those
                                frameworks will control how you write code and
                                will completely change your mind of coding
                                rather than writing some basic HTML, CSS &
                                JavaScript code.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, try to understand the underlying logic of
                                those frameworks and get them in to your code.
                                Don't just do what the documentation says like a
                                trained machined.

                                4. Learn by doing. - Do Projects.

                            <p>
                                This is the most important thing to do in order
                                to become a well-experinced frontend developer.
                                People can't just learn every concept, memorize
                                them and use them when they obtained a job.
                                Nobody can obtain a job like that though. So,
                                you have to learn some core concepts and do some
                                projects by applying those concepts in that
                                project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From the beginner I told don't try to memorize
                                things because doing projects will help you to
                                memorize things with zero effort. It's like
                                memorizing math formulas by solving hundreds of
                                problems right?
                            </p>

                                {" "}
                                When doing projects you will encounter some
                                circumstances which need new knowledge. So, you
                                can google those and learn new things as well.
                                As JavaScript has thousands of functions and
                                methods it's not practical to learn-then-apply
                                approach but apply-then-learn approach. I'll
                                provide you some resources to get some project
                                ideas after you leanred the core concepts of
                                frontend development.
